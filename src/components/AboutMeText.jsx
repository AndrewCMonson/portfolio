					A father, husband and software engineer. I spent a decade in the
					United States Air Force before entering the tech industry as a
					technical recruiter. Not long after, I discovered my love for web
					development and am now pursuing it as a career. My toolbelt includes
					MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and more. I&apos;ve never met a
					challenge I didn&apos;t like and am always looking for new
					opportunities to learn. When I&apos;m not working, I enjoy running,
					golfing, and spending time with my family.
